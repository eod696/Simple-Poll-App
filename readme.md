# A simple poll application
This app is built with Django.  Currently, there is no requirements file for pip, so it is assumed you have installed Django.  There are no other requirements for this project at this time.  

## Expected modules in the future
* Django-CKEditor https://github.com/shaunsephton/django-ckeditor
(I've wanted to learn something more about CKEditor ever since I lived through the nightmare of configuring and working with TinyMCE.  I'm hoping it's easier to work with.)
